        <h2><strong>why Choose Us?</strong></h2>
        <p class="section-subtitle">When selecting an academy, your initial inquiry should be: Who will be teaching me,
            and how extensive is their practical experience with real clients or brides?</p>
        <h5>Many academies and artists have primarily teaching backgrounds and limited hands-on experience with actual
            brides. While studying under them may provide valuable theoretical knowledge, it may not adequately prepare
            you for the challenges of real-world clientsâ€”such asstron <strong> diverse skin types, textures, face and
                eye shapes, varying degrees of darkness, pigmentation issues, and the specific demands of real-world
                scenarios</strong>.</h5>
        <h4>At our academy, we prioritize teaching <strong>Makeup techniques</strong> that not only excel in photographs
            but also thrive in real-world settings, enduring throughout weddings and events in front of diverse
            audiences. This is where our approach sets us apart.</h4>
        <h5>With her extensive experience handling thousands of brides, <strong>Kumari Nitu Rani</strong> distills the
            essence
            of her real-world expertise into our curriculum.</h5>
